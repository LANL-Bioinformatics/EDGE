# EDGE Bioinformatics

This is version 2.x.x-dev of EDGE Bioinformatics, a product of Los Alamos National Laboratory, Naval Medical Research Center, and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

The development version is for developer previews and not intended for normal use. User can use it to get a preview of the latest work but you may find some glitches and something not work as expected. Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/LANL-Bioinformatics/EDGE/issues) on the github if you have any. 

EDGE is a highly adaptable bioinformatics platform that allows laboratories to quickly analyze and interpret genomic sequence data. The bioinformatics platform allows users to address a wide range of use cases including assay validation and the characterization of novel biological threats, clinical samples, and complex environmental samples.

To demo EDGE, go to https://bioedge.lanl.gov/ or https://edgebioinformatics.org/ and follow the "GUI" instructions from our documentation, found at https://edge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction.html. It is also linked at the bottom of the EDGE homepage.
